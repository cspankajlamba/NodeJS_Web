    <div class="text-lg">Website Visitors</div>
    <div class="text-md">
        Like most website operators, Piotech INDIA collects non-personally-identifying information that web
        browsers and servers typically make available, including browser type, language preference, referring
        site,
        and the date and time of each visitor request. We use this information to better understand how visitors
        use
        our website. Occasionally, we may share non-personally-identifying information in aggregate form to
        analyze
        trends in website usage.
        <br>
        Piotech INDIA may also collect potentially personally-identifying information, such as Internet Protocol
        (IP) addresses, for logged-in users and users leaving comments on our blog posts. We will only disclose
        these IP addresses under the same circumstances that we use and disclose personally-identifying
        information,
        as described below.

        To assist our support team in diagnosing product-related issues, we may request that you share a license
        key, name, email address, a copy of your website, or login details. As the website owner, you are
        responsible for your data's privacy, so we strongly encourage you to provide a staging site without
        personal
        information before sharing any data with us.

        gateways adhere to PCI-DSS standards set by the PCI Security Standards Council.

    <div class="text-lg">License Keys</div>
    <div class="text-md">
        To validate a purchase and unlock benefits such as automatic updates and developer support, a license
        key is
